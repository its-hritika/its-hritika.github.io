Hello, I'm **Hritika Singh** from Mumbai, India 

Passionate about cybersecurity, I am currently pursuing the Certified Ethical Hacker v13 (CEHv13) & eJPTv2 certification 
to strengthen my skills in ethical hacking, network security, and vulnerability assessment. With a background in 
commerce and a degree in Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS), I bring a unique perspective to cybersecurity, 
blending analytical thinking with a business-oriented mindset.

Transitioning from a commerce background into the world of cybersecurity has been an exciting challenge, fueling 
my curiosity to understand and mitigate cyber threats. I am eager to connect with professionals in the field, 
learn continuously, and contribute to securing digital assets.
